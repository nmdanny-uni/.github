A collection of tests I've made for various course assignments in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (years 2018-2021), which were migrated 
from my user at the [CSE Github Instance](https://github.cs.huji.ac.il/danielkerbel). Issues, forks and pull requests were not migrated, so if you have
a CSE user, you might want to peek there for further insights.

These tests will not be updated so I encourage other students to fork them and adapt them to newer versions of these courses.
